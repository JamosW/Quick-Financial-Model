# Stock Valuation Shiny Web Application

## Overview

Valuing companies take a lot of time! If you're like me and you don't have the time to do a full valuation on a company because of life obligations but you also don't want to just park your money in an ETF or recommended stocks, this app is created for you.
This app allows you enter your valuation metrics, do a quick valuation and help you decided whether the company or stock of interest is worth taking a deeper look!
By utilizing financial metrics and user-provided inputs, the application provides real-time stock valuation insights, enabling informed investment decisions.

This app serves two purposes: 
1. Quick and dirty valuation to help you decide if the stock is worth investing time and energy to asses
2. Post-financial-model visualization of your stock/investments calculated value.
